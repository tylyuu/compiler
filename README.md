# compiler
This is a full-phase compiler that transforms WLP4, a simplified C-style language, into MIPS machine code; due to course policy, only header files are displayed for functionality overview, with complete code available upon request.

## Components

### Assembler
- **Functionality**: Converts MIPS assembly code into binary machine code.
- **Usage**: Processes assembly code written in MIPS syntax and outputs corresponding binary code.

### Scanner
- **Functionality**: Scans WLP4 code and outputs tokens with their types.
- **Usage**: Reads WLP4 source code and breaks it down into a series of tokens, each labeled with an appropriate type for further processing.

### Parser
- **Functionality**: Parses WLP4 code to output a parse tree.
- **Usage**: Analyzes the tokens produced by the Scanner to construct a parse tree, which represents the syntactic structure of the code.

### Context-Sensitive Checker
- **Functionality**: Checks for context-specific errors in the WLP4 code.
- **Usage**: Performs semantic analysis on the parse tree to ensure that the code adheres to the language's rules and conventions.

### Code Generator
- **Functionality**: Converts WLP4 code into MIPS machine code.
- **Usage**: Transforms the validated WLP4 code into MIPS assembly instructions, which are then assembled into machine code by the Assembler.
